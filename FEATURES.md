# Skrift — Feature Source of Truth

One table of every feature across **both** native apps: what it does, which app has
it, where it lives, and its status. This is the canonical map — when you add or change
a feature, **update this file in the same commit**. Linked from `CLAUDE.md`.

Paths are relative to `Skrift_Native/`. Mobile = `SkriftMobile/`, Desktop = `SkriftDesktop/`.

**Status legend:** ✅ shipped · 🟡 partial · 🧩 stub/placeholder · ➖ not present (by design or not yet)

> Generated 2026-06-09 from a full read of both codebases. The contract spine
> (multipart upload, RAW transcript, names LWW) is in `CLAUDE.md` "Hard rules".

## Recording & live transcription  *(mobile-owned)*

| Capability | Mobile | Desktop | Key files | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Record / pause / resume / stop | ✅ | ➖ | `Features/Recording/RecordView.swift` | Pause hides paused interval from elapsed time. **Instant record (2026-06-11): every entry auto-starts** (FAB, + append, Siri/widget — unified path) |
| Live caption (auto-scroll + color-by-confidence) | ✅ | ➖ | `RecordView.swift` (LiveCaption) | ✅ 2026-06-09: native auto-scroll+scrollback; finalized text solid / trailing words lighter (positional **approximation** — FluidAudio exposes no volatile flag); inline tinted `[photo N]` tokens |
| Live waveform (40-bar) | ✅ | ➖ | `RecordView.swift:453-480` | |
| Model preload status | ✅ | n/a | `RecordView.swift:271-292` | ✅ 2026-06-09: in-place "model loading" placeholder in the caption during record-while-loading, cleared once words arrive |
| Caption polling | ✅ | ➖ | `Services/Recording/LiveRecordingService.swift:231-243` | 0.6s timer |
| Audio-route-change handling (AirPods pull-out) | ✅ | n/a | `LiveRecordingService.swift` | ✅ 2026-06-12 (rev 2, per the DevLog device-trace verdict): on every route transition the tap is torn down and REINSTALLED in the CURRENT hardware format — the install precondition compares the vended tap format against the SESSION's live hw format (cross-rate rebuilds like AirPods 24k ↔ built-in 48k are ACCEPTED; the per-install `AVAudioConverter` bridges tap→file; only transient 0Hz/0ch or vended≠session-hw states are refused — the earlier hw==old-format check refused all cross-rate rebuilds and recordings went DEAF). Rebuild retries back off ~3 s total and NEVER permanently give up: route-change + `AVAudioEngineConfigurationChange` + media-services-reset observers re-arm the rebuild; resume() also rebuilds if the tap died while paused. Engine restarted + amber notice names the new input. Every decision DevLogged. Also exposes `LiveRecordingService.isRecordingActive` (MainActor static, true incl. paused) so the audiobook player ignores remote-play mid-recording. Unit-tested: format-change decision, tap-install precondition (cross-rate accept + transient refusals), backoff/re-arm contract, converter selection, conversion continuity, active-flag lifecycle (`LiveRecordingRouteChangeTests.swift`) |
| Conversation-mode toggle (diarize this take) | ✅ | ✅ | `RecordView.swift:100-111` · desktop `Models/AppSettings.swift:28-30` | |
| Append to an existing recording | ✅ | ➖ | `MemoDetailView.swift` (`add-recording-button` + ⋯ menu); merge `MemoSaver.swift` | ✅ 2026-06-09: visible top-right **+** button added (also in ⋯ menu); append flow verified |

Gating LIVE: 0 = phone-only, >0 syncs |
| Tags add/remove | ✅ | ✅ | mobile `MemoDetailView.swift:201-217`; desktop `NoteProperties.swift:120` | |

| Row label source | ✅ | ✅ | `MemosListView.swift`; `Models/MemoDisplay.swift` | ✅ 2026-06-09: titled memos lead with the user `title` (transcript snippet as secondary); untitled keep transcript-first |
| Status pill (synced/waiting/transcribing) | ✅ | ✅ | `MemosListView.swift`; `Models/MemoDisplay.swift` | ✅ 2026-06-09: significance-0 (phone-only) memos show **no** sync pill; transcribing/error always show; >0 keeps Waiting/Synced |
| Search / sort / filter | ✅ | ✅ | `MemosListView.swift:290-332` | place / has-photos / unsynced filters |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Audiobook library + player (Bound-style) | ✅ | n/a | `Features/Audiobooks/*`, `Services/Audiobooks/*` | Files/iCloud import (copy into app), tags/cover/m4b chapters, per-book resume, speed, sleep timer, background + lock-screen transport (`AudiobookSession`); readable multi-file chapter titles (`ChapterDisplay` — LCP-strip + "Chapter N" prettify, 2026-06-12); Edit book details after import (player ⋯ → `EditBookDetailsView`: title/author/cover via PhotosPicker, falls back to current art; persists via store + live `refreshFromStore`, 2026-06-12) |
| Retroactive quote capture | ✅ | n/a | `CaptureMomentView` (micro-scrubber + grains), `CaptureMath` (span + OUTWARD sentence-snap), `QuoteCaptureProcessor` | Capture proposes [pause−30s→pause]; span±20s transcribed on demand; quote audio = the memo's audio. Round 2 (2026-06-12): all labels BOOK time, pan = window only (handle drags window-confined, no edge-bump), "⟲ pause point" jump-back, grains only mid-drag + mute toggle, audio session untouched until first drag |
| Capture sheet (ramble-first) | ✅ | n/a | `CaptureSheetView`; ramble = `RecordView(appendTo:)` | Big record-your-thoughts, Save & keep listening, circles; book auto-pauses/resumes; long quotes scroll in a bounded block (2026-06-12) |
| Conditional mini-player + list integration | ✅ | n/a | `AudiobookMiniPlayerBar` (C3), mounted in `MemosListView` | Exists only while a session is active; FAB nudges up; capture rows = book glyph + italic ❝-quote lead. 72pt bar (2026-06-12, replaces the oversized 104pt): cover 48, transport 40/17pt, Capture pill 12pt bold wrap-proof (fixedSize+lineLimit), chevron 30×40 — width-budget arithmetic in the source. Remote/AirPods play is IGNORED while a recording is live (`LiveRecordingService.isRecordingActive` guard, session priority) |
| Capture memo rendering (detail) | ✅ | n/a | `MemoDetail/TranscriptBodyView.swift` + `CaptureQuote` (`Models/MemoDisplay.swift`) | ✅ 2026-06-12: ONE 3-mode component — editing = styled quote (accent bar + attribution) above the quote-protected ramble editor; playing = full-text karaoke over quote+ramble (`Memo.karaokeText`, markers stripped, sidecar-aligned from word 0); reading (transcribing) = styled quote + pill, no editor |
| Book metadata contract (C2) | ✅ | ✅ | mobile `MemoMetadata`/`UploadPayload` (+bookTitle/bookAuthor/bookChapter, additive); desktop `Compiler.swift` PhoneMetadata | Byte-compatible; absent = old behavior |
| Quote protection in enhancement | n/a | ✅ | `Pipeline/Enhancement/QuoteProtection.swift`, `EnhancementService`, `BatchRunner` (byte-assert gate) | Copy-edit touches ONLY the ramble; quote byte-identical or full fallback to unedited |
| Quote export (italics + attribution) | n/a | ✅ | `Compiler.swift` | `> — [[Author]], *Book*, ch. N` inside the blockquote; `[[Author]]` written at export only (never in names DB); frontmatter book/bookAuthor/chapter |
| Resolver per-occurrence INSTANT apply | n/a | ✅ | `Sanitiser.applyPartialOccurrences`, `InlineResolver`, `NoteDisplayView` | Each pick renders immediately (document-order demotion correct); "N of M assigned" progress |

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Diarize (Sortformer) + fuse to turns | 🟡 | ✅ | desktop `Engines/DiarizationService.swift`, `Pipeline/Diarization/SpeakerFusion.swift` | Mobile records w/ conversation toggle; heavy fusion is desktop-side |

| Persist diarization segments (for later enrollment) | n/a (phone keeps `diar_<id>.json`) | ✅ | desktop `Models/PipelineFile.swift` (`diarizationSegments`) + `Pipeline/BatchManager/DiarizationSidecar.swift` | ✅ 2026-06-09: written by BatchRunner; byte-mirrors the phone sidecar — unblocks Mac "name a speaker" |

| Capture items (share URL/text/image) | ➖ | ➖ | — | Big deferred cross-app feature (`backlog.md:73`) |

## Transcription engine *(desktop in-process)* / on-device *(mobile)*

| Unlink a `[[Name]]` (click a linked mention) | ➖ | ✅ | `Features/Review/BodyTextView.swift` (popover), `NoteDisplayView.swift` (apply + undo toast), `Sanitiser.swift` (`unlinkOccurrence`/`unlinkAll`/`process(neverLink:)`) | Per signed-off `mocks/name-unlink.html`: exactly TWO scopes — this mention → plain alias as spoken (possessive kept), or all mentions in this note (persists on `PipelineFile.unlinkedNames` so reprocess won't re-link). Inline undo toast stays until dismissed |
