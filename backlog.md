# Skrift — Backlog

Deferred ideas and features, captured during the 2026-06 overhaul planning so they're not lost. Not scheduled — pull from here when ready.

## North star — "see how my thinking evolved over time"
The eventual reason the app exists. When I add a note about a realization, surface related notes from across the years and lay them on a timeline ("you had a similar thought in 2019, it shifted in 2021, here's where you are now").
- **Backbone (reachable now, offline):** semantic search across the whole vault using local embedding models; retrieve + rank related notes; timeline UI. Mostly engineering, not model-limited.
- **Harder part (deferred):** having a local LLM *narrate* the evolution well — same quality ceiling as the stale-summary problem. Defer until local models are good enough.

## Other deferred items
- **Watched-folder ingest** — point Skrift at a folder (e.g. the Mac Voice Memos export) for zero-friction auto-ingest. (The overhaul keeps ingest simple: drag/picker + phone sync.)
- **Summary prompt quality** — summaries read stale / not in my voice. Dedicated prompt-tuning pass once the rest is stable.
- **Tagging matchable-subset + lemma expansion** — which vault tags are auto-matchable (flag-per-tag vs separate list) and conjugation/lemma handling. Being decided in the mobile-app chat; align the desktop to it.
- **Git housekeeping** — remove the empty `claude/competent-haslett-718d5a` worktree; finish mining `robustness-cleanup` for any remaining good fixes before deleting it.
