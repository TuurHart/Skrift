/// The Mac AUTHORS Memos ⑤ (`MAC_CLOUDKIT_PLAN.md` direction, Q5 2026-07-21 lock): a file
/// ingested locally on the Mac (the +Upload button / drag-drop, `IngestService`; a future
/// `UploadService` local caller) becomes a synced `Memo` like any phone capture — "Mac-only
/// files" stop existing. Before this, ZERO desktop code constructed a `Memo`; local uploads
/// made only `PipelineFile`s, invisible to the phone.
///
/// **Pure + host-less testable**, like `MemoCloudIngest`/`MacCloudWriteBack`: every entry point
/// takes its `ModelContext` explicitly rather than touching `MemoCloudStore.container` itself, so
/// the core logic unit-tests with a plain in-memory container. Only `authorLocalUpload` (the
/// `UploadService` hook) resolves the real container, gated exactly like `MacCloudMetaSync`.
///
/// **Two ways a local file gets authored:**
/// - INSTANT: `UploadService.ingest(parts:memoID:)`'s local branch (`memoID == nil`) calls
///   `authorLocalUpload` per created row. In the current app this branch has no real caller yet
///   (Bonjour, its historical caller, is retired) — it's forward-compatible plumbing.
/// - SWEPT: `backfill`, hooked into `MemoCloudReconciler`'s reconcile sweep, scans every local
///   `PipelineFile` with a UUID id and no `Memo` yet. This is what actually covers the live
///   +Upload-button/drag-drop path (`IngestService`), which mints `UUID().uuidString` ids but
///   never touches `UploadService` — the sweep picks those rows up on the next reconcile,
///   whichever local path created them, without this file ever depending on `IngestService`.
///
/// `reflectTranscripts` is the companion: once a Mac-authored memo's `PipelineFile` gets
/// transcribed by the normal pipeline (BatchRunner), copy that transcript back onto the `Memo` so
/// it reaches the phone — without touching the processing coordinator (out of this lane's scope).
